          is an artist and educator living and working in Berkeley, CA.
          He holds an MFA from UC Berkeley, and a BA from Reed College. His work
          has been shown across the United States, including at the Berkeley Art
          Museum, Pallas Gallery, Well-Well Projects, Root Division, Aggregate
          Space Gallery, and SOMarts Cultural Center, among others. He is the
          recipient of several awards including the San Francisco Foundation
          Cadogan Award, the Eisner Prize for Excellence in Creative Practice,
          and the Kaspar Locher Fellowship. He is currently an adjunct professor in art and
          design at the University of San Francisco.

        <p>
          His practice is invested in using digital technologies
          sculpturally, foregrounding their material. He inverts viewers'
          preconceived notions of what a "device" might look or act like by
          creating confounding DIY electronic sculptures. In this act of
          defamiliarization, Bartz gestures towards a speculative future in
          which everyday technologies might appear alien and have uses outside
          of the extremely narrow framework we currently conceive of them in.
