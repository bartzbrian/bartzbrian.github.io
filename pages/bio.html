          is an interdisciplinary sculptor and educator living and working in Berkeley, CA. He completed an
          MFA in art practice at UC Berkeley in 2020, and received a BA in fine art from Reed College in 2017. His work
          has been shown across the United States, including at the Berkeley Art Museum, Well Well Projects, Pallas
          Gallery, Soldes Gallery, and more. He is currently an adjunct professor in art and design at the University of
          San Francisco.

          Through his work, he seeks to defamiliarize our relationship with technology, often by making electronic
          sculptures with functions that are speculative, useless, poetic, or simply for their own sake. More recently,
          he has been particularly captivated by the aesthetics of communication technologies such as radio and
          satellites, and the ways they interact across landscape and place. Some of the research interests which
          animate his work include depictions of terraforming in science fiction, the present day effects of cold war
          militarization, and, more recently, the relationship between technology, mysticism, and the cosmos.
